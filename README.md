# Comparative study of KNN and Decision Tree in prediction of Heart Disease
Data Analytics Project

Heart disease is one of the most common causes of death these days, and accurate prediction of heart disease is considered to be one of the most important topics in the domain of clinical data analysis. Complex tests to check the patient's health condition can be performed in hospitals with the help of doctors and physicians, but it is vital to keep monitoring the patient's health parameters when they are at home. For this purpose, there is a need for a simple and easy to implement algorithm which is capable of accurately predicting heart disease using some key parameters relating to the patientâ€™s health. This paper explores the effectiveness of KNN algorithm and Decision Tree in predicting heart disease on data obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. To optimize results, the best K value is found using an elbow plot for KNN and pruning is performed on the Decision Tree to prevent overfitting.
